## 🚀 Problem Statement

Predict the `GradeClass` of a student (categorical performance level) using features such as:
- Age, Gender, Ethnicity
- Parental Education
- Weekly Study Time
- Tutoring and Parental Support
- Extracurricular activities
- GPA and Absences

---

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset consists of multiple attributes of students and their final `GradeClass`. The target variable is categorical:
- 1.0 to 4.0 (e.g., 1 = High performance, 4 = Low performance)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📊 Model Used

A **Random Forest Classifier** was used due to its accuracy and robustness. The model achieved:
- ✅ Accuracy: 91%
- 🧠 Weighted Avg F1-Score: 0.91
